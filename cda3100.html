	<br>3. Can we always decrease the execution time of a program by adding more processors to the task?
	</p>
	<div class="msg_body">
		<p>
		1. Parallel Speedup = T<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>P</sub>, where P is the number of processors.
		<br><br>2. Amdahl's Law states that the maximum speedup attainable by improvement in the execution of a program is limited by the fraction of the program that doesn't benefit from the improvement.
		<br><br>It is formulated as:
		<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Speedup = T<sub>old</sub>/T<sub>new</sub>
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;T<sub>old</sub>/T<sub>new</sub> = 1/((1-Fraction<sub>unimproved</sub>) + (Fraction<sub>improved</sub>/Speedup<sub>improved</sub>))
		<br><br>3. No.  In terms of improvement from parallelization, Amdahl's Law states that speedup is limited by the sequential component of the program. So if a program executes in 3 hours, and 1 hour is spent executing sequential code, whereas the other 2 are spent executing code that can be parallelized, then we can't reduce the execution time of the program below 1 hour by adding more processors to the task.

	<br><h3>[ Number Conversion ]</h3>

		1. Convert 123<sub>10</sub> to binary.

		<br>3. Convert 345<sub>8</sub> to decimal.
		<br>4. Convert F1C4<sub>16</sub> to decimal.
		<br>5. Convert ABCD<sub>16</sub> to binary.
		</p>
	<div class="msg_body">
		<p>
		1. 123<sub>10</sub> can be converted to binary by repeated division by two and noting the remainder at each step:
		<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;123/2 = 61 R1
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;61/2 = 30 R1
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;30/2 = 15 R0
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;15/2 = 7 R1
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;7/2 = 3 R1
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;3/2 = 1 R1
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;1/2 = 0 R1
		<br><br>Then place the remainder of each division step, starting at the top, into a binary digit, starting at the least significant position.  If we're using a Little Endian 8-bit representation and assuming byte addresses increase to the left, this would be:
		<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;0111 1011 = 123<sub>10</sub>

		<br><br>2. 100111001101<sub>2</sub> to decimal:
		<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;2<sup>0</sup> = 1
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;2<sup>2</sup> = 4
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;2<sup>3</sup> = 8
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;2<sup>6</sup> = 64
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;2<sup>7</sup> = 128
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;2<sup>8</sup> = 256
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;2<sup>11</sup> = 2048
		<br><br>Add them together to get:
		<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;100111001101<sub>2</sub> = 2509

		<br><br>3. 345<sub>8</sub> = 3*8<sup>2</sup> + 4*8<sup>1</sup> + 5*8<sup>0</sup> = 229

		<br><br>4. F1C4<sub>16</sub> = 15*16<sup>3</sup> + 1*16<sup>2</sup> + 12*16<sup>1</sup> + 4*16<sup>0</sup> = 61892<sub>10</sub>.
		<br><br>5. To convert ABCD<sub>16</sub> to binary note that 4 bits are required to represent each hex digit:
		<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;ABCD<sub>16</sub> = 1010 1011 1100 1101

	<br><h3>[ Signed Binary Representations ]</h3>

	<div class="msg_list">
		<p class="msg_head">
		1. Why use two's complement instead of just using a sign bit?
		<br>2. Why is it called "two's complement"?
		</p>
	<div class="msg_body">
		<p>
		1. Basically, it simplifies the work the hardware has to do when handling operations involving signed integers.
		<br><br>For an example of this, consider using a simple binary magnitude representation:
		<br><br>Then an operation like 4+(-2) in binary would yield:
		<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;0100 + 1010 = 1110 = -6
		<br><br>So the hardware would actually have to check for signed integers and handle them in a different way.
		<br><br>However, using the two's complement version of -2 we get:
		<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;0100 + 1110 = 0010 = 2
		<br><br>which is what we expect for 4+(-2).
		<br><br>Also, consider that extending an integer in binary to fill more bits is easier using two's complement, since we merely extend the sign bit to fill the new bit locations, whereas using binary magnitude representation would have required that only the left-most bit match the sign bit.

		<br><br>2. It is called “two’s complement” because to negate an integer, you subtract it from 2<sup>N</sup>.  It's actually a radix complement where the radix is 2.
		<br><br><i>The radix is the number of unique digits, including zero, used to represent numbers in a positional numeral system.</i>

		<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;For example, to get -2 in two's complement using 4 bits:
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;2<sup>4</sup> - 2 = 14 = 1110 = -2 in two's complement

		<br><br>2. Take the complement of the number (i.e., flip all the bits) to get:
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;-3 = 1111 1100
		<br><br>3. To get the two's complement, add 1 to the one's complement:
		<br>&emsp;&emsp;-3 = 1111 1100 + 1 = 1111 1101

		<p>
		--Load and store instructions--
		These instructions store data from a register to memory, or load data from memory into a register.
		They both take a register source, called the <b>base register</b>, and an immediate field (16-bit in MIPS), called the offset, as operands.
		The sum—called the <b>effective address</b>—of the contents of the base register and the sign-extended offset is used as a memory address.

		--Branches and jumps--
		Branches are conditional transfers of control.
