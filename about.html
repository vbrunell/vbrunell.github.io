<h2>Welcome to my site</h2>

<h3>What you can find here</h3>
<p>
I'm a graduate student in computer science at Florida State University.  My research interests include compilers, computer architecture, programming langauge design, data science, and machine learning.  Currently, I'm working on completing thesis resarch involving code optimization using an optimizing compiler and a new computer architecture framework.
</p>

<p>
Before entering the CS program at FSU, I spent five years in Japan working for the Ministry of Education as a high school English teacher and coordinator for the English teaching program in Tokushima Prefecture.  After returning to the States, I briefly dabbled in law school at UF and managed a small business in Tallahassee for a couple of years.
</p>

<p>
As far as hobbies and recreation not related to CS go, I play chess and Go, read sci-fi (in English and Japanese), travel, hike, camp, fish, kayak, and do other outdoorsy activities.
